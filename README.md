### An Accounting, Bookkeeping & Financial Analysis Engine for the Django Framework.

__Django Ledger__ is a double entry accounting system based on
the [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com),
which aims to power financially driven applications by removing the complexity of the accounting domain into a simple,
high-level API. _Prior experience with Django is required to more effectively use this software_. 

__Django Ledger__ was created and is currently maintained and developed by lead developer Miguel Sanda.

The software is still in early stages of development. For more information, please check the
[Roadmap](https://github.com/arrobalytics/django-ledger/blob/develop/ROADMAP.md).

### How long until all features are implemented?

Finance and Accounting is a complicated subject. Django Ledger is different from other Django projects
as it aims to provide a developer-friendly accounting engine while providing a reliable and extensible API to
power financially driven applications. This project in particular, not only requires Python AND Django programming
experience, but also finance and accounting experience. So, that's the long way of saying, we need your help!
