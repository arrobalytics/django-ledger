Chart Of Account: This is a basically the entire collection of all the accounts that is present and a logical aggregation of those accounts.
The Chart of accounts is the backbone of making of any financial statements. Transactions are recorded into individual accounts based on their individual type.
The accounts which are of a similar nature will be grouped and classified accordingly.

For instance: We can have a heading as "Fixed Asssets" in the Balance Sheet, which will consists of Tangible, Intangible assets.

Further, the tangible assets will consists of multiple accounts like Building, Plant & Equipments, Machinery, Furnitures.
So, aggregation of balances of individual accounts based on the Chart of accounts , helps in prerapartion of the Financial Statements.
