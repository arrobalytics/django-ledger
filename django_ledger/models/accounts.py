    In addition to the attributes mentioned below, it also has the the fields/columns/attributes mentioned in the ParentChileMixin & the CreateUpdateMixIn. Read about these mixin here.

    Below are the fields specific to the vendor model.

    @uuid : this is a unique primary key generated for the table. the default value of this fields is set as the unique uuid generated.

    @code: Each account will have its own code for e.g Cash Account -> Code 1010 , Inventory -> 1200.

    @name: This is the user defined name  of the Account. the maximum length for Name of the ledger allowed is 100

    @role : Each Account needs to be assigned a certain Role. The exhaustive list of ROLES is defined in io.roles.

    @balance_type: Each account will have a default Account type i.e Either Debit or Credit.

    For example: Assets like Cash, Inventory, Accounts_receivable or Expenses like Rent, Salary will have BALANCE_TYPE="Debit"
    Liabilities, Equities and Income like Payables, Loans, Income, Sales, Reserves will have BALANCE_TYPE="Credit"

    @active: Determines whether the concerned account is active. Any Account can be used only when it is unlocked and Active Default value is set to False i.e Unlocked

    @coa: Each Accounts must be assigned a set of Chart_of_Accounts. By default ,one CoA will be created for each entity .
    All account created within that particular entity will all be mapped to that coa.

    @on_coa: This object has been created for the purpose of the managing the models and in turn handling the database

    Some Meta Information: (Additional data points regarding this model that may alter its behavior)

    @abstract: This is a abstract class and will be used through inheritance. Separate implementation can be done for this abstract class.
    [It may also be noted that models are not created for the abstract models, but only for the models which implements the abstract model class]

    @verbose_name: A human readable name for this Model (Also translatable to other languages with django translation> gettext_lazy)

    @unique_together: the concantanation of coa & account code would remain unique throughout the model i.e database

    @indexes : Index created on different attributes for better db & search queries
